      <h3>origin of sprite</h3>
      <p>The Sprite brand name was created by T. C. "Bud" Evans, a Houston-based bottler who also distributed Coca-Cola products, circa 1955 for a line of drinks with flavors such as strawberry and orange; the rights to the name were acquired by the Coca-Cola Company in 1960.

        The lemon-lime drink known today as Sprite was developed in West Germany in 1959 as Fanta Klare Zitrone ("Fanta Clear Lemon" in English) and was introduced in the United States under the Sprite name in 1961 as a competitor to 7 Up.</p>
     <h3>formula change</h3>
     <p>A further formula change happened in the UK in 2018. This formula change, done to coincide with the sugary drinks tax in the country, reduces the sugar amount and replaces stevia with aspartame and acesulfame K. This formula was later extended to other regions across the world to coincide with similar sugar tax rules.In the Netherlands in March 2017, Coca-Cola announced that Sprite would be relaunched exclusively as a sugar-free drink, with the standard variety being discontinued and Sprite Zero being renamed as simply Sprite. This change was expanded to Ireland in 2018.In Australia, Sprite was relaunched with a new recipe containing 40% less sugar (compared with old Sprite) in August 2019. Unlike most of the reformulations which use aspartame, this version doesn't, instead using sucralose in addition to acesulfame K.In March 2023, Coca-Cola announced another further formula change for Sprite and Sprite Zero Sugar in the United Kingdom, produced to differentiate the two varieties. The new formula has slightly increased sugar content but still contains aspartame and acesulfame K. Some territories including France, Poland and Germany use a similar lower-sugar formula but do not utilize any artificial sweeteners.</p>
